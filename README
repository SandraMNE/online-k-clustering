This implementation implements online-k-clustering algorithm as mentioned in this paper(http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~dasgupta/291/lec6.pdf). It is a produces REALTIME k-clustering on an infinite stream of data(Yes! you heard it right, it's realtime :-)). It is implemented on top of twitter storm and uses cassandra as database. It deals with 2-dimensional matrices and clusters in Euclidean space.
